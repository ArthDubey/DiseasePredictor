# Disease-Prediction-System
This system aims to predict accurately the disease a person is suffering from based on the symptoms provided by the user. It is a website made using the Flask framework in python. 

# Principle
The prediction system mainly uses Naive Bayes algorithm to predict disease. Along with that we ask the user to add the intensity level of the symptom he is suffering from. Hence the probability score is a combined result of Naive Bayes and intensity level.

# Dataset

After running main.py in Visual Studio Code you can run the website on the localhost refer terminal.PNG

While working with flask create a directory say website and then place the above downloaded files (static, template) in the same directory. 

Also while adding symptoms if you don't wish to add more you can put none.
